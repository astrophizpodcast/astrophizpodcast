👋 Hi, 
Welcome to the Astrophiz podcasts. 

Each month we love bringing you two fabulous episodes; On the first of each month, our friend, molecular pharmacologist, toxicologist and amateur astronomer, Dr Ian ‘Astroblog’ Musgrave brings you his monthly SkyGuide with all the essential observational highlights for telescopers, astrophotographers and naked eye observers. 
Each month, Ian also includes “Ian's Tangent” where he takes us on a short journey of astronomical wonder.

In the middle of each month, we bring you an exclusive and in-depth interview with a noted astrophysicist, astronomer, particle physicist, radio telescope engineer, data scientist or space scientist.![image](https://github.com/astrophizpodcast/astrophizpodcast/assets/150576038/cb323ff5-282f-4779-b9cc-4a499916ab2e)
